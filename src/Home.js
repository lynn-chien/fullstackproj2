            <h3> Saiyra</h3>
            <p> Hello everyone!! My name is Saiyra and I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley. I grew up eating a lot of South Asian food so that is probably my favorite and I definitely like spicy food too. I love trying new things; one time I even tried a fish eye when I was visiting China! Be sure to check out my blog to see some of the best places to eat in Berkeley!</p>
